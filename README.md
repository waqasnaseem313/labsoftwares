## 📘 Overview

**Soil Texture Calculator** is a unique, lab-friendly tool designed to **calculate soil texture using actual hydrometer readings** from laboratory tests. Unlike typical soil texture apps that require users to input the percentages of sand, silt, and clay directly, this tool starts from **raw hydrometer data**, making it scientifically accurate and suitable for researchers, students, and lab technicians.

## ✅ Features

- 🔬 **Supports Hydrometer Method:** Input hydrometer readings (Rsc and Rc) with corresponding temperatures.
- 🧪 **Corrects for Blank Readings:** Ensures accurate corrections for Rsc and Rc using blank values.
- 📊 **Calculates Soil Components:** Automatically computes:
  - Sand (%)
  - Silt (%)
  - Clay (%)
- 📚 **Classifies Soil Texture:** Uses USDA soil texture classification chart.
- 🔁 **Handles Multiple Samples:** Ideal for batch processing in soil testing laboratories.
- 📤 **Exports to CSV:** Download results for record-keeping, reports, or further analysis.

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Enter blank readings** for Rsc and Rc and their respective temperatures.
2. **Add soil samples** by clicking the "Add Sample" button.
3. For each sample, input:
   - Soil weight (g)
   - Rsc (40-sec reading)
   - Temperature at Rsc
   - Rc (4-hour reading)
   - Temperature at Rc
4. Click **"Calculate All"** to process data.
5. View results and optionally **export to CSV**.
